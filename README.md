# MoltenSlime

Currently developed own SlimeVR PCB design, based on artemis/frosty Frozen Slime v2. ##TODO ADD LINK

The main goal in this project is to accomodate FrozenSlime mainboard to adapt to (accessible for me) 18650 holder and adding (an optional!) GY-271 magnetometer.
I managed to trace the whole board without using vias, also avoided placing traces under sensors to minimize data noise.
